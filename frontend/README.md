# godo-frontend

This is the front-end for my task management application called godo.
It is written in flutter and it is my first time using it.

## Run

Call `flutter run` or `flutter run--release` to run the app.

## Issues

For now, the app does not persist any data from the database of the device itself.
This means, that all the task management requires an internet connection as well as it has an added delay to the actions as we require the backend to do work in the background.
